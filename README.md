# Welcome to our COSC55 24X Final Project!

This project was completed as part of the COSC55: Security and Privacy course in August 2024.  Using AWS, we researched, designed, and implemented a cloud security solution over the span of 4 weeks.  We created an example organization, SecureCare Clinic, with clinical services, pharmacy management, human resources and staff management, finance, and IT and technical support departments, and implemented various features to enhance security.  Our deployed environment utilizes AWS services including Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and VPC subnets, Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2) Red Hat instances, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, and our security solution involves security groups, bucket policies, and server-side encryption with Amazon KMS keys (SSE-KMS).

Please see our wiki page for details and our documented security solution.  Thanks for checking it out! :)
